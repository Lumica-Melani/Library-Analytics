# Library Catalogue

A modern Library Catalogue web application built with React and Redux.
This project allows users to browse books by category and explore curated collections using a clean, state-driven UI.

Built as a learning-focused yet production-ready frontend project.

---

# Features

- Browse books by category

- Genre-based filtering

- Ratings, likes, and popularity indicators

- Static image assets handled correctly for deployment

- Fast and responsive UI

- Global state management using Redux

- Derived data for efficient rendering

# Why this project?

Frontend applications often fail due to poor data handling and duplicated state.

---

# This project focuses on:

- Using derived data instead of storing redundant state

- Managing shared state predictably with Redux

- Building scalable component structures

- Understanding how UI reacts to state changes

- Preparing a React app for static deployment

- It simulates how a real catalogue system works without relying on a backend.
